		oldest, biggest and most trusted 3rd party payment gateway in India.
		CCAvenue uses the latest encryption technology to protect your credit
		card information. It encrypts your credit card number so that it
		cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. <br /><br />We do not
		store any credit card details with us as the transactions are done
		directly between the buyers and the payment gateway</div>
